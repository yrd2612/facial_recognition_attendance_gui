The previous version which I built was based on Tkinter. Though it works good but I wanted to give my application a more modern look with new animations.  
The framework which I am using is FLET. The functionality remains same but the look and feel of the application is completely revamped.  
It has now got cleaner animations and popup messages too.  
I am attaching some pictures for your refernce.
